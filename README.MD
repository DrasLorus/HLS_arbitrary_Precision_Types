# HLS Arbitrary Precision Types Library

This repository provides simulation code of HLS Arbitrary Precision Types.

The code is based from headers shipped with Vivado (*in 2019...*),
but due to absence of synthesis support **it should not be used in an HLS project targeting FPGA**.

For synthesis, the repository owner (A.K.A [DrasLorus](https://github.com/DrasLorus)) strongly recommends the use of XilinxÂ® provided headers, which are *unfortunately* proprietary software.

## Compatibility

- *(Legacy)* Tested with g++ (GCC) 6.2.0 on x86_64 GNU/Linux.
- Tested with clang (LLVM) 13.0.0 and g++ (GCC) 11.1.0 on x86_64 GNU/Linux.

## Usage

Include the `ap_int.h` or `ap_fixed.h` in C++ code,
and set compiler option to add the path of `include` directory in this repo
into header search directory list.

``` shell
$ cd examples/ap_int
$ g++ -I ../../include/ test.cpp
$ ./a.out
a = 11.3137 (0x0b.504ea4p0)
b = 11.3137 (0x0b.504f33p0)
c = a + b = 22.6274 (0x16.a09dd7p0)
$
```
